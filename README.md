# Flipr-Hackathon-Hiring-Program-4.0
Module 04: Machine Learning 

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic. Epidemiologists are teaming up with data scientists to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus by tapping big data, machine learning and other digital tools. The goal is to get real-time forecasts and other critical information to front-line health-care workers and public policy makers as the outbreak unfolds. The objective of the Hackathon is to predict the probability of person getting infected by Covid-19.  

Problem Statement:

India has 197 Total cases, out of which there are 4 deaths reported and 173 of those cases are still active. With a hope of controlling the epidemic, this machine learning problem is designed to cater the need of a prediction model that can predict the probability of a person getting infected by covid-19.  
 
The whole world is participating in a fight against this pandemic. The healthcare data science community can have a big impact on combating this disease. There have been many excellent efforts to use data visualization and monte carlo simulations to help combat the spread of this pandemic. The expected prediction model would address a complimentary and important aspect of health policy, identifying those most at risk. By combining the efforts of these and many other excellent efforts in the healthcare technology space, we hope to mitigate the effects of this terrible disease. 
 
Part -01 : The objective of the first part of the problem statement is to predict the probability of a person getting infected by Covid-19 on 20th March 2020. The output file 01 should contain only people_ID and the respective infect_prob for the test data. 
 
Part -02 : The Diuresis of a person is a time-dependent parameter, for which you have to come up with a Time-series prediction model. Using the Diuresis predicted by the model, you need to calculate the infect_prob on 27th March 2020 for every people_ID in the test data. . The output file 02 should contain only people_ID and the respective infect_prob on 27th March.
